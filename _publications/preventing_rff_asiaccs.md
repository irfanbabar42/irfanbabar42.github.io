Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) enables passive identification and tracking of wireless devices, posing significant privacy concerns. This paper introduces a novel defense mechanism using low-power friendly jamming to prevent unauthorized device fingerprinting. Our approach strategically introduces controlled interference to obscure the unique hardware signatures that enable RFF, while preserving the quality of legitimate communications. We demonstrate through extensive experiments that our method effectively prevents malicious eavesdroppers from identifying and tracking devices, thereby restoring user privacy in wireless communications without degrading network performance.
