Robust chaotic systems, due to their inherent properties of mixing, ergodicity, and larger chaotic parameter space, constitute a perfect candidate for cryptography. This paper reports a novel method to generate random numbers using modified robust logistic map (MRLM). The non-smooth probability distribution function of robust logistic map (RLM) trajectories gives an un-even binary distribution in randomness test. To overcome this disadvantage in RLM, control of chaos (CoC) is proposed for smooth probability distribution function of RLM. For testing the proposed design, cryptographic random numbers generated by MRLM were vetted with National Institute of Standards and Technology statistical test suite (NIST 800-22). The results showed that proposed MRLM generates cryptographically secure random numbers (CSPRNG).
