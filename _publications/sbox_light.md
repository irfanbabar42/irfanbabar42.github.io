In the era of pervasive computing, a generation of lightweight ciphers was needed to provide near-optimal security; officially, NIST announced the standard lightweight cryptographic primitive. The newly announced standard, ASCON, is based on a 5-bit input and 5-bit output Substitution Box (S-box). This paper proposes a key-dependent S-box methodology for small-size S-box for Internet of Things (IoT) devices widely used in many applications such as Smart Grids, healthcare, etc. We aided this study with the chaotic logistic map to generate a robust S-box. The key-dependent S-box can add an extra layer of security to the cryptosystem specifically for lightweight devices at the minimal cost of generation time of a new S-box. We have investigated the proposed methodology with cryptographic properties of S-box, such as Differential Probability (DP), Linear Probability (LP), Nonlinearity, Strict Avalanche Criteria (SAC), Boomerang Connectivity Table (BCT), Key-space analysis, and implementation on Arduino. We also compared the proposed methodology with other state-of-the-art (SOTA) 5 â€“ bit input and output S-boxes. Experimental results witness the robustness of the proposed study.
