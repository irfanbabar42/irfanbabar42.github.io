Smart grid infrastructures are increasingly vulnerable to sophisticated jamming attacks that can disrupt critical communications. This paper presents a deep learning-based approach for detecting jamming attacks in smart grid communication networks. We leverage neural network architectures to analyze signal characteristics and identify anomalous patterns indicative of jamming interference. Our methodology achieves high detection accuracy while maintaining low false positive rates, enabling timely response to security threats in power grid communications. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach across various jamming scenarios and power levels.
