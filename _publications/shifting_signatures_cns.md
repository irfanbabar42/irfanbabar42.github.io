Radio Frequency Fingerprinting relies on the assumption that device hardware imperfections create stable, unique signatures. This paper challenges this fundamental assumption by demonstrating the ephemeral nature of radio fingerprints on the USRP X310 Software Defined Radio platform. We show that fingerprint signatures can shift following power cycles and FPGA image reloading operations, leading to what we term "fingerprint mutations." Our extensive experimental analysis reveals that radio devices may exhibit multiple fingerprints over time, challenging the common assumption of fingerprint persistence. These findings have significant implications for the reliability and practical deployment of RFF-based authentication systems.
