Power Line Communications (PLC) is a widely deployed technology enabling devices to communicate over existing electrical wiring infrastructure. This paper presents a comprehensive study on device fingerprinting in PLC networks, leveraging physical layer characteristics to uniquely identify devices. Our approach analyzes the inherent hardware imperfections that create unique signatures in transmitted signals, enabling reliable device authentication without cryptographic overhead. The proposed methodology demonstrates high accuracy in distinguishing between different PLC devices, contributing to enhanced security in smart grid and IoT deployments.
