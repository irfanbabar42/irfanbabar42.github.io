Radio Frequency Fingerprinting (RFF) is an emerging technology for device authentication at the physical layer. This paper provides a comprehensive analysis of RFF models, methodologies, and performance metrics. We systematically evaluate different approaches to extract and classify radio frequency fingerprints, comparing their effectiveness across various scenarios. Our findings provide insights into the strengths and limitations of current RFF techniques, offering guidance for practical deployment in wireless security applications.
