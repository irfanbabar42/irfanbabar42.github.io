I am a **Ph.D. candidate in Computer Science and Engineering** at [Hamad Bin Khalifa University (HBKU)](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en) in Doha, Qatar (expected January 2026), working under the supervision of [Dr. Gabriele Oligeri](https://www.hbku.edu.qa/en/cse/staff/gabriele-oligeri). My doctoral research focuses on **physical layer security in power line communications**, leveraging deep learning for jamming detection and device authentication via radio frequency fingerprinting, with applications in **smart grid security**.

Research Focus
======
My Ph.D. dissertation is at the intersection of **cybersecurity and deep learning**, addressing critical security challenges in smart grid communications:

**Jamming Detection in Power Line Communications:**
- Developed deep learning models for jamming detection considering two real-world scenarios
- When adversarial information is available: trained models detect jammers even when bit-error-rate is approximately zero
- When adversarial profile is unavailable: designed autoencoders with physical layer features to detect anomalies from smart adversaries who can change their jamming strategies
- Both approaches detect jammers from significant distances, enabling early alarm generation for countermeasures

**Device Fingerprinting via Radio Frequency:**
- Designed communication pipelines to transmit data over power lines in the presence of electricity
- Developed neural networks for device identification using physical layer features
- Provided tradeoffs between different neural network architectures regarding time and accuracy
- RFF enables secure, passive device identification, particularly where traditional authentication is vulnerable to spoofing

**Privacy Protection against Radio Fingerprinting:**
- Proposed methods to protect user privacy from adversarial device identification
- Developed low-power jamming techniques to sanitize transmitted signals of their fingerprints
- Demonstrated that friendly jammers effectively block malicious eavesdroppers without affecting link quality

**Reliability of Radio Frequency Fingerprinting:**
- Investigated the ephemeral nature of RF fingerprints on USRP X310 Software Defined Radios
- Demonstrated fingerprint mutations occur during firmware reloads, not just power cycles
- Introduced methodology for abstracting fingerprint mutations into graphs
- Proved that RF fingerprints are time-independent probabilistic phenomena requiring multiple samples for reliability

Research Interests
======
- **Smart Grid Security**: Detection and localization of False Data Injection (FDI) attacks, jamming detection in power line communications
- **Radio Frequency Fingerprinting**: Device identification at the physical layer, reliability analysis, and privacy-preserving techniques

- **Deep Learning for Security**: Leveraging machine learning techniques for attack detection and device fingerprinting
